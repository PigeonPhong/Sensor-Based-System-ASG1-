Light &amp; Distance Sensor System

This system is designed as a compact environmental monitoring and detection tool. It combines an ultrasonic distance sensor and an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor to provide real-time information about the surrounding environment. The ultrasonic sensor measures distances, allowing users to gauge proximity to objects or obstacles, while the LDR sensor detects light levels, providing insights into ambient brightness.
